# OrbitFabric

OrbitFabric is a model-first Mission Data Fabric for small spacecraft.

Within the wider OrbitFabric ecosystem, this repository is referred to as **OrbitFabric Core**: the semantic authority that loads, validates, exercises and exports the Mission Data Contract through explicit engineering boundaries.

It provides a disciplined way to define a spacecraft Mission Data Contract once and reuse the same validated semantics across software integration, documentation, host-side scenario evidence, generated contract artifacts, machine-readable inspection surfaces and external ecosystem integrations.

OrbitFabric Core is intentionally not a flight software framework, ground segment, mission control system or spacecraft simulator. Its job is narrower and more foundational: keep mission data semantics explicit, consistent, reviewable and reusable across the engineering lifecycle.

## Why OrbitFabric exists

Small spacecraft projects often repeat the same mission information in many places:

```text
flight software structures
ground dictionaries
test fixtures
simulation inputs
documentation
payload integration notes
fault handling logic
storage and downlink assumptions
operations procedures
external tool configuration
```

Each independent copy can drift.

OrbitFabric addresses that problem by making the Mission Data Contract explicit and machine-readable. Core loads that contract once, validates it, derives structured evidence and exports controlled surfaces that downstream tools can consume without rebuilding mission meaning for themselves.

The central rule is:

```text
The Mission Model is the semantic source of truth.
OrbitFabric Core owns Mission Data Contract interpretation.
Derived artifacts remain derived.
Downstream tools consume explicit Core-owned facts.
```

## Mission Data Contract

The Mission Data Contract is expressed as a multi-file YAML Mission Model.

The current stable model covers:

```text
spacecraft identity and mission metadata
subsystems
operational modes and mode transitions
telemetry
commands
events
faults
packets
policies
payload contracts
data products
storage and retention intent
contact and downlink assumptions
commandability
autonomy and recovery intent
```

Operational scenarios are defined separately in YAML and exercise the contract as deterministic host-side evidence.

Typical mission layout:

```text
mission/
  spacecraft.yaml
  subsystems.yaml
  modes.yaml
  telemetry.yaml
  commands.yaml
  events.yaml
  faults.yaml
  packets.yaml
  policies.yaml
  payloads.yaml
  data_products.yaml
  contacts.yaml
  commandability.yaml

scenarios/
  *.yaml
```

Optional model domains remain optional where documented. Their documented field names, meanings, identifiers, references and controlled values are compatibility-sensitive from the stable v1 Mission Data Contract onward.

## What Core does

OrbitFabric Core turns the Mission Model into a coherent engineering workflow.

### Load, validate and lint

Core performs structural validation and semantic linting, with stable diagnostic ownership and machine-readable lint reports.

```bash
orbitfabric inspect mission examples/demo-3u/mission/
orbitfabric lint examples/demo-3u/mission/
```

### Execute deterministic scenario evidence

Scenarios provide host-side evidence for declared mission behavior and expectations.

```bash
orbitfabric validate scenario examples/demo-3u/scenarios/battery_low_during_payload.yaml
orbitfabric sim examples/demo-3u/scenarios/battery_low_during_payload.yaml
```

Scenario evidence is not flight execution and not a spacecraft dynamics simulation.

### Generate mission documentation

Core generates documentation directly from the validated Mission Model.

```bash
orbitfabric gen docs examples/demo-3u/mission/
orbitfabric gen data-flow examples/demo-3u/mission/
```

Generated Markdown is reviewable and reproducible, but it is not the source of truth.

### Generate runtime-facing contract bindings

```bash
orbitfabric gen runtime examples/demo-3u/mission/
```

The current `cpp17` profile generates deterministic identifiers, metadata registries, command argument structures, abstract adapter interfaces and a C++17 host-build smoke target.

These outputs are contract bindings. They do not implement onboard scheduling, command dispatch, telemetry polling, drivers, RTOS behavior or flight logic.

### Generate ground-facing contract artifacts

```bash
orbitfabric gen ground examples/demo-3u/mission/
```

The current generic ground profile generates reviewable JSON, CSV and Markdown contract artifacts.

These outputs are integration artifacts. They do not implement a telemetry archive, database, operator console, command uplink service or live ground segment.

## Core-owned machine-readable surfaces

OrbitFabric exposes structured surfaces so downstream tools do not need to parse terminal text, generated Markdown or raw YAML independently.

Stable Core-owned surfaces include:

```text
lint JSON report
simulation JSON report
model_summary.json
entity_index.json
relationship_manifest.json for admitted families
mission_snapshot.json
Core Integration Input Set
```

They answer different questions:

```text
model_summary.json          What contract domains are present?
entity_index.json           What contract entities are defined?
relationship_manifest.json  Which explicit admitted relationships connect them?
mission_snapshot.json       What complete Mission Model did Core actually load?
```

The seven FDIR relationship families admitted in v1.2.0 are additive stable-compatible relationships derived from explicit Mission Model fields. Unknown relationship types must never receive guessed semantics from a consumer.

## Stable Core Integration Input boundary

OrbitFabric v1.2.0 consolidated the production-facing Core input side of the generic Integration Framework as a stable compatibility boundary.

The supported workflow is:

```bash
orbitfabric export integration-input-set examples/demo-3u/mission/ \
  --output-dir examples/demo-3u/generated/reports/integration_input
```

The coherent set contains:

```text
integration_input_manifest.json
mission_snapshot.json
entity_index.json
relationship_manifest.json
lint_report.json
model_summary.json
```

Core produces the set from one logical load/lint operation. The manifest records required and companion roles, availability, surface kind and version, SHA-256 digests, load and lint state, and a deterministic RFC 8785/JCS-based `input_set_sha256` fingerprint. The manifest is published last.

An external integration must reject an incompatible required surface. It must not reconstruct OrbitFabric semantics by reparsing Mission Model YAML as a fallback.

The existing wire identifiers remain `0.1-candidate` for compatibility with the already reference-proven producer and consumer chain. Stability classification and format-version text are separate compatibility concepts.

## Candidate Core inspection surfaces

The following Core-owned surfaces introduced in v1.1.0 remain candidate after v1.3.0:

```text
dashboard_summary.json
scenario_run_index.json
coverage_summary.json
simulation JSON structured expectation accounting
```

They are useful machine-readable inspection surfaces, but their existence does not turn Core into a dashboard backend, coverage product, Studio API or formal verification engine.

## Generic Integration Framework

OrbitFabric also defines a generic external integration architecture:

```text
Mission Model
    -> OrbitFabric Core
    -> coherent Core Integration Input Set
    -> Projection Profile
    -> external Integration Package / Adapter
    -> Integration Result
    -> downstream consumer
```

Ownership is explicit:

```text
OrbitFabric Core       Mission Data Contract semantics and coherent inputs
Projection Profile     Authored target-specific projection intent
Integration Adapter    Target validation, projection and artifact generation
Integration Result     Mappings, artifacts, diagnostics, coverage and provenance
Downstream tools       Navigation, presentation and orchestration of explicit records
```

The original Projection Profile, Integration Result and Integration Package / Adapter Execution contracts remain available as the frozen `0.1-candidate` / `orbitfabric.adapter_cli.v0` lane.

OrbitFabric also publishes a candidate operation-input lane for external integration conformance:

```text
Manifest 0.2-candidate
orbitfabric.adapter_cli.v1
Result 0.2-candidate
```

The v1 lane keeps IISS and Projection Profile as common context and allows zero or one required file-backed operation input. The first contract-defined role is `scenario`. Core publishes JSON Schemas, positive/negative fixtures and a reusable conformance checker. This remains an extension contract and does not move adapter execution or target semantics into Core.

Core also publishes the independently versioned
`orbitfabric.scenario_projection_accounting` `0.1-candidate` artifact
contract. A Scenario-consuming adapter can use it to declare complete or
explicitly partial disposition for exact Scenario atoms, with parent-local
mapping references and exact Result/artifact/source provenance.

Core does not import ecosystem-specific adapter code in-process. Adapter execution, when requested through Adapter Manager, uses the documented external adapter execution contract and an installed environment-local entrypoint.

The OpenOBSW/OpenSVF reference integration was used as an early forcing function for this architecture without moving OpenOBSW, OpenSVF, YAMCS, PUS or other target-specific semantics into Core.

## Adapter Management foundation

OrbitFabric v1.3.0 adds the first candidate Core-owned lifecycle for exact external adapter releases.

The Core side is deliberately provider-neutral:

```text
Adapter Project Lock
    -> exact Adapter Catalog selection
    -> provider-specific Release Source outside Core
    -> ResolvedAdapterRelease
    -> Core Adapter Manager lifecycle
    -> Installed Adapter State
    -> verify / execute / remove
```

Core owns:

```text
exact Source Coordinate and release identity
Adapter Release Descriptor conformance
project-scoped desired state through Adapter Project Lock
user-scoped Installed Adapter State
installation transaction and backend verification
provider-neutral Catalog model and exact selection
```

Core does **not** own provider-specific acquisition. GitHub Releases, future registries or other providers remain external Release Sources that resolve exact bytes and hand a verified `ResolvedAdapterRelease` into Core.

The candidate Core CLI includes:

```text
orbitfabric adapter install
orbitfabric adapter list
orbitfabric adapter inspect
orbitfabric adapter verify
orbitfabric adapter execute
orbitfabric adapter remove

orbitfabric adapter lock validate
orbitfabric adapter lock check
orbitfabric adapter lock install

orbitfabric adapter catalog validate
orbitfabric adapter catalog list
orbitfabric adapter catalog select
```

The 1.4.0 candidate composes the supported GitHub acquisition package with Core lifecycle management through `orbitfabric adapter install <adapter> --version <exact-version>`. See [public onboarding](docs/reference/public-adapter-onboarding.md) for distribution, exact selection and Catalog snapshot provenance.

See [Adapter Manager M0](docs/reference/adapter-manager-m0.md), [Adapter Project Lock M1](docs/reference/adapter-project-lock-m1.md), [Explicit-Source Install from Adapter Project Lock](docs/reference/adapter-install-from-lock-explicit-source.md) and [Adapter Catalog CLI](docs/reference/adapter-catalog-cli.md).

## Place in the OrbitFabric ecosystem

OrbitFabric Core is the semantic authority at the center of the wider [OrbitFabric ecosystem](https://github.com/OrbitFabric).

Studio, the Reference Mission, integration adapters and adapter-management infrastructure consume, exercise or distribute Core-owned contracts without becoming parallel sources of mission semantics.

The ownership rule remains:

```text
Core owns mission semantics.
Studio makes Core-owned facts understandable.
Adapters own explicit target-specific projection.
External systems remain authoritative for native behavior.
Evidence bounds the claims made about each integration.
```

This repository therefore documents **Core itself**: the Mission Data Contract, validation and linting, scenario evidence, generated and machine-readable surfaces, integration boundaries, compatibility posture and provider-neutral adapter lifecycle semantics.

For the complete ecosystem map, the role of each public repository and recommended entry points, see the [OrbitFabric GitHub Organization](https://github.com/OrbitFabric).

## Current Core version and compatibility posture

Current Core version:

```text
v1.3.0 - Adapter Management Foundation
```

The stable Mission Data Contract commitment started with `v1.0.0`. v1.2.0 extended that stable boundary additively with Mission Snapshot, the coherent Core Integration Input Set and seven explicit FDIR Relationship Manifest families. v1.3.0 preserves those stable semantics and adds candidate operation-input and Adapter Management product capabilities.

No new Mission Model semantics are introduced by v1.3.0.

The release classification is intentionally mixed rather than pretending every surface has the same maturity:

```text
Stable v1.x
  Mission Model documented semantics
  structural validation and semantic lint policy
  scenario YAML evidence inputs
  lint JSON report
  simulation JSON report
  model_summary.json
  entity_index.json
  relationship_manifest.json for admitted families
  mission_snapshot.json
  Core Integration Input Set
  documented stable CLI workflows
  compatibility and extensibility governance

Candidate Core inspection surfaces
  dashboard_summary.json
  scenario_run_index.json
  coverage_summary.json
  simulation JSON structured expectation accounting

Candidate integration / Adapter Management surfaces
  Projection Profile
  Integration Result
  Integration Package / Adapter Execution
  operation-input v1 contract lane
  Adapter Release Descriptor
  Adapter Project Lock
  Adapter Manager lifecycle
  explicit-source install-from-lock
  source-neutral resolved-release attachment
  Adapter Catalog model and CLI

Generated public-preview artifacts
  C++17 runtime-facing bindings
  runtime contract manifest
  generic ground dictionaries and manifest
  generated Markdown documentation
  plain-text logs
```

See [v1.3.0 release notes](docs/releases/v1.3.0.md), [Stability and Compatibility Contract](docs/reference/stability-compatibility-contract.md), [v1.2 Integration Input Stability Decision](docs/reference/v1.2-integration-input-stability-decision.md) and [Release Compatibility Policy](docs/reference/release-compatibility-policy.md).

## Demo mission

The built-in synthetic demo lives under:

```text
examples/demo-3u/
```

It demonstrates a compact Mission Data Chain including:

```text
payload.start_acquisition
    -> payload.acquisition_started
    -> payload.radiation_histogram
    -> storage intent
    -> downlink intent
    -> downlink flow
    -> contact window
    -> scenario evidence
    -> runtime-facing bindings
    -> ground-facing artifacts
    -> Core-owned structured surfaces
    -> coherent Integration Input Set
```

The demo is deliberately synthetic and clean-room. It proves contract continuity, not flight readiness, protocol compliance or operational completeness.

Other example slices include:

```text
examples/university-cubesat-minislice/
examples/oresat-inspired-minislice/
examples/finch-inspired-minislice/
examples/spacelab-inspired-communications-minislice/
```

The inspired examples use public material only as an external modeling boundary. They do not imply endorsement, adoption or validated integration by the referenced projects.

User implementation code and downstream integration code must live outside generated output directories.

## Engineering rules

OrbitFabric development follows a few strict rules:

1. Keep the Mission Model as the semantic source of truth.
2. Do not let generators, adapters or downstream tools create a parallel Mission Model interpretation.
3. Prefer explicit diagnostics and explicit relationships over inference.
4. Keep runtime and ground artifacts generated, deterministic and disposable unless explicitly classified otherwise.
5. Treat stable surface changes as compatibility-sensitive engineering changes.
6. Prefer additive evolution where it preserves existing meaning.
7. Do not move target-specific integration semantics into Core.
8. Keep ecosystem adapter code and provider-specific acquisition outside Core; external execution must use documented contracts and lifecycle boundaries rather than in-process loading.
9. Protect meaningful stable fields with selective regression signatures instead of freezing incidental formatting.
10. Keep public examples synthetic or based only on material that can legally be used in an open-source project.
